If you are not a developers (e.g. Data Scientist/ Analyst) who never use virtual enviroments and one day you want to know which packages you have actively install, which ones are dependencies that was automatically installed. Good luck! Here is a simple jupyter notebook to help you solve this pip mistry. And please, start to use virtual enviroments tools such as:

* [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)
* [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
* [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

*Thanks to my friend [Alexander Hendorf](https://github.com/alanderex) for the inspiration*
